Surrey North West is represented by patriotic Conservative Bob Rogers MP. At a constituency surgery, Bob notices Montgomery Smithe OBE, owner of a company that deals in the sale of aeroplane engines, based in the Surrey North West constituency. The local economy is heavily reliant on the financial success the company. Approaching Bob in a less than calm manner, Montgomery explains to Bob his frustration with newly announced [fictitious] EU Regulation imposing a ban on the export of large aeroplane engines, when they are intended to be fitted on aeroplanes with a passenger capacity of less than 250. This is part of a policy aimed at reducing the carbon emissions of air travel. Montgomery’s company has invested £45 000 000 in research to produce the new engine design. Montgomery is determined to fight and has come to his MP for support. A few days later at Prime Ministers Questions, Bob confronts the Prime Minister demanding that he ignore the Regulation. In response, he is told that as an EU Member State, the UK is obliged to implement EU Regulations regardless of the views of individual MP’s, although this is not necessarily the case had the instruction been given in a Directive. Bob, angered by this view takes to his feet and declares ‘we are the British Parliament and we are supreme…’. Bob’s speech continues for some time. He is eventually ejected from the chamber. Is Bob Rogers MP correct in his assertion of British parliamentary supremacy?
